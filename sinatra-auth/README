get '/' do
  session[:greeting] = "Hello WOrls"
  "Hello work"
end

get '/remember' do
  session[:greeting]
end

This should be impossible -- It will keep the above -- maintain the state -- set some state on request num 1 --

but when you went to request two every web request happens independently

requst 1
request 1 the state that was set on the previous request was maintained -- becuase of the cookie.

If you udate the cookie -- you wont see the hello world -- anything thats on a cookie, a user can edit (never put private info)


get '/' do
  session[:greeting] = "Hello WOrls"
  response.set_cookie 'credit_amount', '100'
  "Hello work"
end

get '/remember' do
  "you hvave #{request.cookies['foo']}"
  session[:greeting]
end

use Rack::MethodOverride
use Rack::Session::Cookie
run ApplicationController

always put data in a session -- dont put data in a cookies


STEPS YOU TOOK

 Created new controller

 'touch app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb'

 Mount controller in config.ru





Authentication

Remember who the user is

create form in login



Question that authenication is asking our application is -- is the user who they claim to be?



First I need users
  URLS
    get request ro sign up and see a --> see a information
  Database

Then I need to get user password_security \
then make sure that i can find a user with their actual password_security
then change log in system to use their email and password to authenticate them

How do we get users?
